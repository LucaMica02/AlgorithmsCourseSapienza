# AlgorithmsCourseSapienza üìö

This repository contains exercises and algorithm implementations from the **Algorithm Design** course, part of the Computer Science Bachelor's degree at Sapienza University of Rome. The focus is on understanding and applying various algorithmic techniques to solve complex problems.

## Course Overview üèõÔ∏è

The **Algorithm Design** course covers a range of fundamental algorithms and problem-solving techniques essential for computer science students. These include:

- **Graph Algorithms**: Techniques for traversing, searching, and optimizing paths in graphs.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Methods for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems and storing the solutions to subproblems to avoid redundant work.
- **Backtracking**: A technique for solving constraint satisfaction problems by exploring possible solutions and backtracking when a solution fails to satisfy the constraints.
- **Divide and Conquer**: A strategy that divides a problem into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem independently, and then combines their solutions to solve the original problem.
- **Greedy Algorithms**: An approach where a problem is solved by choosing the best option at each step with the hope of finding the global optimum.

## Prerequisites üõ†Ô∏è
Programming Language: The exercises are implemented in Python, so a basic understanding of Python is required.
Mathematical Foundations: A good knowledge of data structures will be helpful in understanding the algorithms.

## Contributing ü§ù
Contributions are welcome! If you have additional exercises, optimizations, or alternative implementations, feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

## Conclusion üîö
This repository serves as a valuable resource for students and enthusiasts looking to deepen their understanding of algorithm design. By working through these exercises, you'll develop strong problem-solving skills that are essential for any computer scientist.
